# Intro

In this series of examples we will figure out basic steps you need to follow to build a UI around any smart contract. We expect a reader to have basic experience with JS.

For React developers, there is an [example](https://github.com/mnill/everscale-crash-course-token-dice-frontend) on how to use that in your React App.

Before we start, lets get acquainted with basic notions of Everscale smart contracts, as we will build a UI around them.

Also, be aware that we borrow some code samples from the full [Everscale Development Guide](https://everscale.guide/) , so donâ€™t hesitate to check that out if you want to dive deeper into the context.
