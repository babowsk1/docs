# Documentation overview

## Welcome

This is the introductory section where you can learn Everscale’s basic concepts, infinite scalability as well as comparisons with Ethereum, Cosmos and Avalanche. 

- [Infinite scalability](infinite-scalability.md)
- [Differences from EVM](differences-from-evm.md)
- [The Lore](lore.md)
- [Glossary](concepts.md)

## Build 

Get familiar with Everscale’s developer tools and start building. Also, please find the guides to install the IDE and write your first smart contract with Everscale. 

- [**Build**](../develop/)
  - [Intro](../develop/intro.md)
  - [Developer Tools Overview](../develop/tools-overview.md)
  - [Smart Contracts](../develop/smart-contracts/)

### Frontend

Connect your wallet and find all the information necessary to write data to the blockchain as well as read it. 

- [Frontend](../develop/frontend/)

### Backend

Deploy smart contracts on the Everscale network and find out all common backend routines. 

  - [Backend](../develop/backend/)

## Validator and full node infrastructure 

Learn Everscale’s validation in case you want to be a validator or just familiarize yourself with the technology. 

- [**Validator and Full Node Infrastructure**](../validate)
  - [Run Validator](../validate/run-validator.md)
